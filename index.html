            Top 5 Favorite Restaurants in my Favorite City!

            So what's my favorite city?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Well, it isn't somewhere well-known or glamorous. It's my hometown of Wenatchee, Washington. If you've not visited Sasquatch's stomping grounds of the glorious Pacific Northwest, you totally should! Even if my recommendations don't sound appetizing, the PNW definitely offers something for everyone. So button-up a hipster flannel and strap on your beanie, and prepare for the journey.

            <li><a href="https://www.sumowen.com/">Sumo Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Restaurant</a></li>
            <p> As the name implies they have sushi and steak, but it's super delicious. Choose from ample different sushi rolls options, or head over to the Hibachi grill where they play with fire, cook your food, and shoot Saki into your mouth. It's a deliciously good time.

            <li><a href="https://www.railstationwenatchee.com/">Rail Station & Ale House</a></li>
            <p>You want burgers? You want a wide variety of local beers on tap? You want a super cozy atmosphere that looks like it belongs in Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter? Boom, go here. Plus, they have a lobster mac&cheese that will make you overeat and breathe heavy afterwards, it's that good.

            <p>
                Stir fry lovers, this joint is for you. Grab a bowl, choose your own veggies, noodles, meat, sauces, then hand it off to watch it get cooked on a giant wok. Roll-up your food into some warm tortillas, and dip your stir-fry treat into a selection of yummy sauces.

            <li><a href="https://www.munchenhaus.com/">Munchen Haus</a></li>
            <p>
                So technically Munchen Haus is in Leavenworth, WA, but its a 30 minute drive from Wenatchee and completely worth it. Not only is Leavenworth an adorable Bavarian town, but Munchen Haus is a bratwurst and beer heaven. That's right, choose your brat, have it grilled, then load it up from a mind-boggling selection of mustards and toppings. Chase it down with a beer and explore the adorable town.

            <li><a href="https://www.garlinisrestaurant.com/">Garlini's Napoletana</a></li>
            <p>
                Pasta! I love pasta and Garlini's is a local Italian restaurant that serves up some delicious options. The alfredo is perfection, their wood fired pizzas feature house made dough and fresh ingredients. To top it off, the atmosphere has the perfect candelight vibe.
