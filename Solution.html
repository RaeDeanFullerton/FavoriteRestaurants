            It isn't like I've solved a complex problem like Matt Damon's character in Good Will Hunting, but it works. I enjoy eating out, but man do I love eating out <em>at home</em>. Sit wherever you want, watch whatever you want, and wear whatever you want. You can enjoy all of this while knowing you won't have a sink full of dishes to clean and a good chance you'll like what you're eating.

            It's easy peasy lemon squeezy. Below is a list of popular food delivery services.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.doordash.com/">DoorDash</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.UberEats.com/">UberEats</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.grubhub.com/">GrubHub</a></li>
            <p>
                And likely there is a local service available as well. A simple web search can find a food delivery service, and you'll be eating in no time.
